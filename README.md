# CS-CameraButtons
Cities Skylines Mod that adds buttons to control the camera

Adds buttons on screen to zoom in, zoom out, move left, move right, move forward, move back. 
Hold button down to move continuously. 

v1.0 
- buttons are now in a (fixed) panel at the bottom right of the screen 
- buttons use arrows and other unicode characters (left/right/forward/back, zoomin/zoomout, rotate camera left/right/up/down) 
- movement is constrainted to complete map area, but you can still move out of playable grids 
- rotate camera up is not working right at max zoom out (in fact, you have to zoom in a lot before it starts working) 
- speed is linear (moving when zoomed in is too fast, while moving when zoomed out is slowish) 

v0.9 (beta) 

Note - movement (left, right, forward, back) not constrained properly yet. You can leave the playing area if you hold the buttons down long enough. 

- I plan to add rotation, better graphical buttons, fix movement
